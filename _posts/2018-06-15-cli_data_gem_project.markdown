For the CLI Data Gem Project, I decided to develop a weather application based on the TimeandDate.com Weather section. The website has a section pertaining to weather which provides you with a list of major cities around the world and allows you to view the weather conditions for any city of interest. Here is the website: https://www.timeanddate.com/weather/. 

The process of developing a Command Line Interface (CLI) application was both challenging and rewarding. The project required me to integrate the different concepts that I have learned throughout the curriculum and apply them to a real-world application. I started the project by creating the project structure, in which I created a Ruby gem, installed dependencies, created the Weather module, created the CLI, Scraper and Weather Conditions classes, and required the files. The project also prompted me to develop a vision for the application and the functionality that I wanted the application to have, thereby implementing the code that would allow me to design the final product that I wanted to build. 

In building the application, I reviewed the HTML and CSS sections from earlier sections in the curriculum which was required for scraping. I also had to review the earlier section on Git and Github in order to save the work onto the Git repository. I used Binding.pry throughout the development of the application in order to debug and ensure that the code that I was writing would extract the exact data that I needed for scraping.

Throughout the process, I also learned to appreciate the work that underlies the websites and applications that we use on the Internet on a daily basis. I had initially contemplated using the GoBe and Starbucks websites in order to develop a travel/day excursion application or a coffee application based on the variety of roasts and blends that Starbucks offers for its coffees. The project prompted me to delve deep into the design of the application and the code that is required in order to build the functionality. The earlier concepts that I wanted to develop for the application had websites with more complex code which utilized Javascript and other interactive features. The concept for my application became simpler over time, as I realized the amount of code required to build a dynamic application and also the material that I still need to learn as I progress through the curriculum. 

Overall, I learned a lot through the CLI Data Gem Project, which challenged me to apply the concepts that I had learned throughout the curriculum. I learned to organize the data into various classes using the single responsibility principle and used Object Oriented Ruby throughout the development of the application. I look forward to continuing with the Flatiron curriculum and building other applications in the future.
