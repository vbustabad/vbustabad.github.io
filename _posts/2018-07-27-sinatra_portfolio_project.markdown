For the Sinatra project, I decided to develop a travel application called Bon Voyage where users can share travel recommendations with each other. The application allows users to make public requests to other members of the community letting them know that they will be traveling to another city and asking for any travel recommendations. Users are able to contribute to the community either by creating a request or responding to another user’s request by providing a recommendation. The application is intended to enhance all members’ travel experiences. 

Overall, I had a great experience developing the Bon Voyage travel application. I felt that I was more comfortable developing an application this second time around compared to my first experience with the CLI project. As I am progressing through the curriculum, I am gaining mastery of all of the concepts and feeling more comfortable being able to design an application from scratch. There are times where I felt challenged to expand the features of the application as I wanted it to be, which led me to learn about how I could add new features to my project. I am constantly learning as I am progressing through the various sections of the curriculum and building projects where I am applying the concepts that I have learned. Similarly, I also had to discover how to debug several error messages that I received which were new and discovered that certain words that are inherent to the Sinatra library should not be used as the library will apply methods towards your unintended variable.

The experience with the travel application helped solidify many of the concepts that we had learned throughout the Sinatra section. Throughout this section, I learned about how to create models for my classes and establish the relationships between them. I created migration files in order to create the tables in my database and the corresponding features (or columns) that are inherent to each of them. I learned about how to establish the navigation for my page via routes, establish the flow of my application via the controller, and how to render the output to the user via the views. As a result of this experience, I am now able to create a web application for Ruby by using the Sinatra domain specific language (DSL). I look forward to learning more and adding other tools to my repertoire as I continue with the curriculum.
