I decided to learn software development because I would like to work in the technology industry. My interest lies in the intersection between marketing and technology. I would like to develop a career either in software engineering or product management. 

I am also interested in the development of new products and services. Having computer programming skills gives you the ability to read and write code. Doing so allows you to write commands to a machine, such as a computer or a mobile device, with specific instructions on how the machine should operate. These skills can be used to solve problems, by designing software and computer systems that address business needs and make processes more efficient. 

I would like to work for a major tech company, such as Google, Facebook or Amazon. Having the computer programming knowledge would allow me not only to understand the customer experience in terms of the content that is being provided, but also in terms of the interactivity and functionality of the platforms that customers are using to engage with the brand. Combining both the marketing and computer programming knowledge will enable me to work with developers, designers and other web specialists in order to develop a cohesive marketing and product design.
