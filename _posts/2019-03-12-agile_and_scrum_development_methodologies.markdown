Agile development is a software development methodology that emphasizes collaboration and cross functional teams in order to accelerate software development and ensure a high-quality end product and high customer satisfaction. Scrum is a particular agile development approach which is widely used and has become increasingly popular. This blog post will focus on Scrum and provide a general overview of the Scrum development process.

*Roles within Scrum*

The Scrum process involves a Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team. 

The Product Owner is responsible for providing clear direction for the software development process. The owner represents the business, customers or users and will communicate the vision for the end product. The Product Owner will also establish the priorities for the product, which will allow the Development Team to prioritize features and tasks for the software development process.

The role of the Scrum Master is to support the Development Team and eliminate any roadblocks or barriers during the process. The Scrum Master is responsible for overseeing the software development process and ensuring that the work is being performed according to the business priorities established by the Product Owner. The Scrum Master also serves as a liaison between business and engineering. 

The Development Team consists of the team members who are responsible for building the software product. According to the Scrum framework, the best performing teams are those which consist of a wide variety of skillsets, including designers, developers, writers, and others. The Development Team is self-organizing and is responsible for divvying up tasks among team members. The Development Team will perform the work during the sprints and will discuss the work progress during the daily standups, as well as seek help for areas that they are stuck on or which have impeded further progress.

*The Scrum Process*

The Scrum process consists of various sprints, which are designated periods of time that typically last between 1 to 4 weeks. The project goals are broken down into particular features or tasks that are required for successful completion of the project. The tasks are then divvied up among various sprints, during which the tasks will be completed. 

The sprint backlog items are established during a sprint planning meeting between the Product Owner, Development Team, and Scrum Master. During this meeting, the tasks that will be designated to a particular sprint are assigned. The Development Team is then responsible for creating a plan and divvying up the tasks among team members in order to complete the tasks by the sprint deadline.

Regular check-ins occur during daily standups throughout the sprint. The daily standups serve as an opportunity to discuss the progress of the work and discuss any roadblocks or other barriers that are being experienced throughout the process.

At the end of every sprint, a sprint review meeting is held. The objective of the sprint review meeting is to review the work that has been completed towards the software product. The meeting will usually consist of a demo of the various features that have been built.

The last step of the Scrum process is the sprint retrospective. The sprint retrospective is an opportunity to reflect on the accomplishments that were achieved during the sprint. The retrospective also serves as an opportunity to reflect on improvements that can be made for the next sprint.
