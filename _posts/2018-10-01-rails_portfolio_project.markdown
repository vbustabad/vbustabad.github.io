I decided to develop an application called Adopt-A-Dog application for the Rails Portfolio Project. The Adopt-A-Dog application is an application that allows users to browse dogs from animal shelters and register as an owner if they would like to adopt a dog. Throughout this project, I incorporated all of the knowledge that I had acquired from the Rails section of the Learn curriculum.

Some of the knowledge that I gained and incorporated into the application include CRUD actions with Rails, RESTful conventions, validations and forms, layouts and partials, URL helpers and omni-authentication. I learned about the powerful Rails framework and discovered ways to abstract code and reduce repetitive work. I struggled at times to understand everything that was going on when I first learned Rails. However, with the Rails Portfolio Project, I felt that the knowledge had solidified for me and I was able to obtain a solid grasp of the material. 

I also incorporated seed data and pictures into the application which made testing the application easier. Although not required for the project, the pictures also made the application come to life and made it interactive, thereby resembling a real-world application. I am still learning to debug errors but am recognizing them better and am able to think through all of the components of the application. With more experience, I expect that the process of building an application from scratch will become second-nature. Overall, I am quite happy with the final product of the Adopt-A-Dog application that I built for the Rails Portfolio Project. I look forward to learning the next section of the curriculum which entails Javascript and incorporating interactive features into any future applications.
